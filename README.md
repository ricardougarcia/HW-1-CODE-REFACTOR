# <HW1 Code Refractor | Horiseon Semantic Code Cleanup and Accessibility Updates>

## Description
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
I WANT to also ensure all links work properly for a fluid user experience

## Installation
The repository for these edits including CSS and HTML sheets can be found on https://github.com/ricardougarcia/HW-1-CODE-REFACTOR.git 
The current site is public and can be found on file:///Users/ricardogarcia/Desktop/Class-Homeworks/HW1-Code-Refractor/index.html

## Usage
The overall look of the webpage should remain the same while CSS and HTML codes are cleaned and optimized. Please refer to   for an example of how the webpage should appear:

:    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
